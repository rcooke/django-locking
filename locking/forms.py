    Since we no longer decorate or extend models as part of locking, this is
    the most reliable way to throw ValidationErrors for hard locks in the
    admin.

    How it works:
        - We override ModelAdmin.get_form in locking.admin.LockableAdminMixin
          so that it uses this function instead of modelform_factory().
        - We create a new class, dynamically, which extends `form` (passed via
          kwarg) and which performs the validation check in _post_clean()
          after calling the super().
        - We pass the new form class in place of the original to
          modelform_factory().
