Based on the Django Locking plugin at stdbrouw/django-locking.  
Forked to fix a number of issues and add in funcitonality to show and edit locks in list mode.

Installation through Pip (pip install django-locking)
subm branch provides git submodule format but is not supported.

Configuration:

1) Add locking to list of INSTALLED_APPS in project settings file

2) Add locking js/css/image media files to admin media folder

3) Add the following Media elements in the app admin file to correspond with the media folder:
Note: If using a newer version of django-grappelli (e.g. 2.3.5), you may have to create an alternate variable in
the settings file that doesn't point to the grappelli folder (i.e. STANDARD_ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX)

class Media:
  js = ( ...,
    settings.ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX + "locking/js/jquery.url.packed.js",
  	"/ajax/admin/variables.js",
		settings.ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX + "locking/js/admin.locking.js?v=1")

  css = ( ...,
    "all": ( ...,
      settings.ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX + "locking/css/locking.css",
    
    )
  )

4) Also add this to the admin file. The changelist_view allows get_lock_for_admin access to the request object.
    from locking import admin as locking_admin

    # In your ModelAdmin class
    get_lock_for_admin = locking_admin.get_lock_for_admin

    def changelist_view(self, request, extra_context=None):
        '''
        We need the request objects in a few places where it's usually not present,
        so we are adding it to PostAdmin object
        '''
        self.request = request
        return super(PostAdmin, self).changelist_view(request, extra_context)

5) Run syncdb for an initial project or create a migration with south to build the database tables
  manage.py schemamigration locking --auto
  manage.py migrate locking

6) To use the list display icon, add the "get_lock_for_admin" method to the list display in the app admin file like so:

from locking.admin import get_lock_for_admin

class AppAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
  list_display = [..., "get_lock_for_admin"]
